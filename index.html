                    I'm a computer science student in Oregon State University's distance program for students seeking a second bachelor's degree. </br>
                    I have lots of hobbies, including weight lifting, reading, and drawing. I have a cat named Lil Peppercorn, and a dog named Delores. I live with my boyfriend of 2+ years, his name is John.<br />
                    I live close to the University of Illinois where I currently work at a local business while still making an effort to stay connected with the community. I volunteer through Code.org, and participated in the 2016 Illinois Hackathon.<br />

                    <p>In hindsight, it seems painfully obvious that I should have pursued Computer Science from the very beginning. As a preteen I spent my free time on my family's home computer exploring everything that Yahoo's Geocities had to offer. I quickly learned HTML, and then CSS, and even a tiny bit of Javascript. I learned how to transfer files via FTP and host a page on my own. Somehow it never dawned on me that this could ever be anything more than a hobby.<br />
                    I pursued art instead. I'm an excellent illustrator, honestly. It always seemed that it would have been such a shame if I had never decided to go into artmaking professionally. I did, for a time. I taught studio art classes privately to young artists in town and to adults while I was in grad school with the University of Illinois. I was good at that too. Somehow... I feel unfulfilled. There's no thrill or challenge. I decided to go back to computers.<br />
                    It was actually being an art educator that introduced me again to coding. As an American art educator coming from one of the best schools in the country I of course was painfully aware of the push to increase the presence of art and science. I learned a little bit of Processing, just to play, and was hooked. I decided to learn Python after that. And then I enrolled in Oregon State University's second degree program for a degree in Computer Science. And now I am looking for a job in tech.<br />

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6 text-left">
                    <p>There is no intention of ever giving up what I learned as a studio artist or as an educator. If anything, the skills to approach problems creatively, see both big pictures and small details, and to seek and accept criticism probably make me a uniquely qualified developer. I don't know how long it might be before I return to education, but teaching also lends me a perspective and skillset that some other developers may lack: I'm an excellent communicator, I am devoted to learning and helping others learn, and I have a deep interest in sharing knowledge with the community. It is this background that has led me to start my blog, ComfyCoding.com, which is currently on hiatus but served as documentation of my experience learning how to code. I still have a lot to learn, of course, and believe that the best place from this point on to learn how to do it is by working on real projects with a team of developers.</p>

                    <p>The ComfyCoding.com project is a long-term project which documents my experience as I learn to code.
                    <br />Although I am currently taking a break from keeping up on this project, I have intentions of continuing to work more so that it can one day become a helpful resource to others learning how to code.</p>

                        <p>Here at home I have rigged a Raspberry Pi 2 to store the data of my school and personal projects. This data can be pulled or pushed from my iMac at home or my Macbook while I'm away. With this I never have to worry about not having up-to-date versions of my work while I'm coding away from home!<br />

                        <p>Although I was already familiar with basic Git commands through Github, this small project has taught me so much more. In particular, establishing a secure connection online that can be accessed remotely, as well as initializing and maintaining a private Git repository.<br />
