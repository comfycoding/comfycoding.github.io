                    <p>In hindsight, it seems painfully obvious that I should have pursued Computer Science from the very beginning. As a preteen I spent my free time on my family's home computer exploring everything that Yahoo's Geocities had to offer. I quickly learned HTML, and then CSS, and even a tiny bit of Javascript. I learned how to transfer files via FTP and host a page on my own. Somehow it never dawned on me that this could ever be anything more than a hobby.<br />
                    I pursued art instead. I'm an excellent illustrator, honestly. It always seemed that it would have been such a shame if I had never decided to go into artmaking professionally. I did, for a time. I taught studio art classes privately to young artists in town and to adults while I was in grad school with the University of Illinois. I was good at that too. Somehow... I feel unfulfilled. There's no thrill or challenge. I decided to go back to computers.<br />
                    It was actually being an art educator that introduced me again to coding. As an American art educator coming from one of the best schools in the country I of course was painfully aware of the push to increase the presence of art and science. I learned a little bit of Processing, just to play, and was hooked. I decided to learn Python after that. And then I enrolled in Oregon State University's second degree program for a degree in Computer Science. And now I am looking for a job in tech.<br />

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6 text-left">
                    <p>There is no intention of ever giving up what I learned as a studio artist or as an educator. If anything, the skills to approach problems creatively, see both big pictures and small details, and to seek and accept criticism probably make me a uniquely qualified developer. I don't know how long it might be before I return to education, but teaching also lends me a perspective and skillset that most other developers lack: I'm an excellent communicator, I am devoted to learning and helping others learn, and I have a deep interest in sharing knowledge with the community. It is this background that has led me to start my blog, <a href="http://comfycoding.com" target="_blank">ComfyCoding.com</a>, which is ongoing documentation of my experience learning how to code. I still have a lot to learn, of course, and believe that the best place from this point on to learn how to do it is by working on real projects with a team of developers.</p>

                    <h3>Remote Raspberry Pi Git Server</h3>
                    <p>Here at home I have rigged a Raspberry Pi 2 to store the data of my school and personal projects. This data can be pulled or pushed from my iMac at home or my Macbook while I'm away. With this I never have to worry about not having up-to-date versions of my work while I'm coding away from home!<br />
                    Although I was already familiar with basic Git commands through Github, this small project has taught me so much more. In particular, establishing a secure connection online that can be accessed remotely, as well as initializing and maintaining a private Git repository.
