					I'm Darlene! I'm an almost-27-year-old currently living in Champaign, Illinois. I moved here from the North Shore (those are the north suburbs of Chicago) to go to grad school at the University of Illinois. I finished my Master's in Education in May 2014. Since then, I've been working a few different jobs in town, barely making rent. It's about time I make a few changes!

					This past fall I decided that I needed to get serious about potentially changing my career. So now I've moved on from art and education to coding! I fully intend to carry all that I've learned as an artist and a teacher into the world of software and web development.
