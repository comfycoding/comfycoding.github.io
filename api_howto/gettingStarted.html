    <h2>Important Links</h2>
    <p>Here are a few pages that we can refer to while navigating this API:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy.com</a> - The Etsy homepage</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/" target="_blank">Etsy.com/developers</a> - Etsy's developer page</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation" target="_blank">Etsy.com/developers/documentation</a> - The page which specifically holds the documentation for the Etsy API</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The very first step to using any API is obtaining an API key. This authenticates the user by assigning each application a unique key that controls the number of callbacks to the API and for other security purposes.

    <h2>Requesting an API Key</h2>
    <p>These keys are basically used to identify who is making a call to the API, as well as how often they are making those calls. Most APIs require that developers receive a key specific to their application, and Etsy is included in that group.</p>

    <p>Luckily for us, getting an API key from Etsy is fairly straightforward! It basically involves registering as a user on Etsy.com, and then <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/register" target="_blank">registering your app</a>. After that, your API key will be made available for each of your applications at <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/your-apps" target="_blank">Etsy.com/developers/your-apps</a>.</p>

    <p>You'll notice that this application actually gives us two keys, one keystring and one share secret key. Keep these handy to get started in the next section!</p>

    <p>After receiving this key, we're ready to start making API calls.</p>
