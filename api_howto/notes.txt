The entire project can be broken down into these pages:

- A splash page, which basically just explains the purpose of the page
  * Can include some content that provides an example of what kind of things we'll be learning

- A guide to gaining an API Key from the webpage.

- The structure of the API request
- Navigating API responses


* from seeing some examples, it's important to keep things linear, but do still allow each page to be easily accessed (for instance the Twitterbot example is completely linear, which makes it more difficult to navigate)
