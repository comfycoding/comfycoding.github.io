    <p>Etsy is a website that allows users to set up shops and sell hand-made and vintage goods. The Etsy.com page itself offers extensive options for both buyers and sellers, and also offers some functionality in their API.</p>

    <h3>What is an API?</h3>
    <p>An API (or Application Program Interface) offers up a web application's services without sacrificing security or offering up its internal structures. This opens up the service for use by developers to use this website's service by embedding it in their own web pages.</p>
    <p>In this tutorial I will work through how someone that sells through Etsy might display a selection of their shop items in a personal website or blog. This is possible using the Etsy API!</p>

    <h2>Important Links</h2>
    <p>Here are a few pages to have handy while navigating this API:</p>
