      <p>Etsy is a website that allows users to set up shops and sell hand-made and vintage goods. The Etsy.com page itself offers extensive options for both buyers and sellers, and also offers full functionality to third party developers by way of their API.</p>

      <h3>What do we hope to achieve?</h3>
      <p>When I was first introduced to this API I was impressed in what it offers to people that sell on Etsy. They have the opportunity to post a shop's most recent listings on a personal website or blog, like this:</p>
      <div id="shop"></div>
      <p>
      <br />
      <p><a href="gettingStarted.html">Let's get started!</a></p>
    </div>
