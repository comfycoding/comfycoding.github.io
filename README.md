This repository is just a test to see the hosting capabilities of github!
I might use this as a test page for my own website, comfycoding.com.

6/23/2016- Followed through with making the page more friendly to mobile devices. The solution consisted of changing some of the settings to the bootstrap.min.css- removing the height attributes to each of the sections, and also adding bottom padding to the sections as well. Tested it on my iPhone, text and div blocks no longer run over into next sections! Next time I would like to further develop the assignment grids and perhaps set something up where those programs that I had written can be run on a webpage.

6/21/2016- Made some slight adjustments to the layout, combined the Top and About section into a single entity. Also modified the Assignments section to be better modularized, it is easier to read and comprehend I think.
I have usually work on this project on a pretty large screen and recently opened it on a smaller laptop (and then opened it again on my iPhone) and realized that it does not stand up well to smaller resolutions. This is going to be the next problem I tackle!
