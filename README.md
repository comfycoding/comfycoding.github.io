# comfycoding.github.io

This repository is just a test to see the hosting capabilities of github!
I might use this as a test page for my own website, comfycoding.com.

Updated 6/21/2016- Made some slight adjustments to the layout, combined the Top and About section into a single entity. Also modified the Assignments section to be better modularized, it is easier to read and comprehend I think.
I have usually work on this project on a pretty large screen and recently opened it on a smaller laptop (and then opened it again on my iPhone) and realized that it does not stand up well to smaller resolutions. This is going to be the next problem I tackle!
